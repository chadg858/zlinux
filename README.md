zLinux Installer
================


This is a collection of scripts, recipes and stratagems to obtain an Ubuntu 18.04 ISO image for the s390x architecture, and then install it on fresh DASD 3390 virtual disk under Hercules.

You just execute the installer by doing:

>sudo ./zlinux_install.bash

The script will proceed to download Ubuntu 18.0.4-5 for s390x in ISO form to your local machine.

It will then ask you to pick a password for the user "zubuntu" on the new system.

After that it will automatically start a modern Hyperion (which is provided with this repo) and run the full Ubuntu 18.04 server installation procedure.

This could take 90 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the speed of your machine.

At the end, the script will shut down Hercules and restart Hercules with the newly installed DASD and you can then ssh into the zLinux instance.



Operation
=========

After the successful install, you start Ubuntu by running the following script:

>./run_zlinux.bash

A standard Ubuntu 18.04 will be installed. It will have full connectivity to the Internet (thru NAT) and you can ssh into the user zubuntu by doing:

>ssh zubuntu@10.1.1.2

and provide the password you specified for this user during installation.

Everything else is just normal Linux; i.e. you can run apt-get, etc., etc.

A few things to know about the generated Ubuntu instance that will IPL from DASD after the install:

>Internal IP:   10.1.1.2
>IP of gateway: 10.1.1.1
>DNS server:    1.1.1.1
>user name:     zubuntu/password as set up by you during installation process

The s/390x Linux instance will connect through a tunnel interface which is set up by the the run_zlinux.bash script in this directory. It then further uses NAT on your default NIC interface to connect to the Internet.



Why Ubuntu 18.04
================

The latest version of Ubuntu supported currently (as of July 2022) by Hercules is Ubuntu 18.04. If you attempt to upgrade an existing Ubuntu 18.04 install to version 20.04 or higher, it will fail on IPL.

By that same token, the last version of CentOS (or RHEL) that will IPL on the current Hercules is CentOS 7, or ClefOS 7.



After Installation
==================

You will have Ubuntu/s390x installed in dasd/hd0.120

You can remove all unnecessary files by executing

>sudo ./cleanup_after_successful_install.bash
